# Scala/ZIO Skill

This skill covers Scala 3 and ZIO ecosystem development for this project. When a topic is relevant, delegate to the appropriate reference file listed below.

## Reference Files

| Topic | File | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| Service setup | `references/SERVICE_SETUP.md` | Mill build conventions, directory structure, package naming, service/config/server patterns |
| Domain modeling | `references/DOMAIN_MODELING.md` | Case classes, enums, newtypes (neotype), opaque types, ZIO JSON codecs, immutability conventions |

## How to Use This Skill

1. Identify which topic area the user's question or task falls under.
2. Read the relevant reference file before responding or writing code.
3. Apply the conventions from that reference. Do not deviate from the established patterns without a good reason.
4. If a task spans multiple topics, read all relevant reference files.

When in doubt about any convention, check `SERVICE_SETUP.md` first — it covers the foundational structure that everything else builds on.
